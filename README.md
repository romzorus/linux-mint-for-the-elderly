# Linux Mint for the elderly



## Goal

After a fresh install of Linux Mint, just run all these scripts to easily make your distribution elderly-friendly.

By elderly-friendly, we mean :
- malware and phishing protection (up to a point of course, we can't prevent a user from giving sensitive informations on the phone but we can block malicious domains used by the attackers)
- adapting default UI/UX settings
- facilitate remote monitoring and intervention by a person of trust

## Description
